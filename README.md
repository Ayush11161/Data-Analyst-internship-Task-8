# Simple Sales Performance Dashboard

##  Project Objective
The goal of this project was to create a basic interactive dashboard to visualize sales performance by product, region, and month. This helps in understanding key business metrics at a glance and deriving actionable insights from sales data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
* **Data Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI 
* **Dataset:** `Superstore_Sales.csv` 

##  Project Steps
1.  **Data Import:** The `Superstore_Sales.csv` dataset was imported into Power BI.
2.  **Data Transformation:** In the Power Query Editor, the `Order Date` column was transformed to create a `Month-Year` column for time-series analysis.
3.  **Dashboard Creation:** The following visuals were created on the canvas:
    * A **Line Chart** to show the sum of sales over different months.
    * A **Bar Chart** to compare the sum of sales across different regions.
    * A **Donut Chart** to display the sales distribution by product category.
4.  **Interactivity:** A **Slicer** was added to filter the entire dashboard by Region, allowing for more granular analysis.

## üí° Key Insights
From the dashboard, we can derive the following insights:

1.  **Technology Dominates Sales:** The "Technology" category is the most significant contributor to revenue, accounting for nearly 827.46K in sales, which represents 36.59% of the total. This indicates it is the most crucial product category for the business.

2.  **West and East are Top Performing Regions:** The West and East regions are the clear leaders in sales performance, significantly outpacing the Central and South regions.The West region shows the highest sales overall. This suggests that marketing and sales efforts are most effective in these coastal areas.

3.  **Sales Trend Shows a Decline:** The line chart indicates a general downward trend in sales over the months displayed, starting from a peak in November and declining in the subsequent months shown. This could point to seasonality or a need to investigate potential causes for the drop in sales.
