# Data-Analyst-internship-Task-8
# Simple Sales Performance Dashboard

##  Project Objective
[cite_start]The goal of this project was to create a basic interactive dashboard to visualize sales performance by product, region, and month[cite: 7]. This helps in understanding key business metrics at a glance and deriving actionable insights from sales data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
* [cite_start]**Data Visualization:** Microsoft Power BI [cite: 9]
* [cite_start]**Dataset:** `Superstore_Sales.csv` [cite: 12]

##  Project Steps
1.  [cite_start]**Data Import:** The `Superstore_Sales.csv` dataset was imported into Power BI[cite: 17].
2.  [cite_start]**Data Transformation:** In the Power Query Editor, the `Order Date` column was transformed to create a `Month-Year` column for time-series analysis[cite: 17].
3.  **Dashboard Creation:** The following visuals were created on the canvas:
    * [cite_start]A **Line Chart** to show the sum of sales over different months[cite: 18].
    * [cite_start]A **Bar Chart** to compare the sum of sales across different regions[cite: 19].
    * [cite_start]A **Donut Chart** to display the sales distribution by product category[cite: 20].
4.  [cite_start]**Interactivity:** A **Slicer** was added to filter the entire dashboard by Region, allowing for more granular analysis[cite: 22].

## üí° Key Insights
[cite_start]From the dashboard, we can derive the following insights[cite: 15]:

1.  [cite_start]**Technology Dominates Sales:** The "Technology" category is the most significant contributor to revenue, accounting for nearly 827.46K in sales, which represents 36.59% of the total[cite: 76, 77, 78]. This indicates it is the most crucial product category for the business.

2.  [cite_start]**West and East are Top Performing Regions:** The West and East regions are the clear leaders in sales performance, significantly outpacing the Central and South regions[cite: 68, 69, 70]. [cite_start]The West region shows the highest sales overall[cite: 69]. This suggests that marketing and sales efforts are most effective in these coastal areas.

3.  [cite_start]**Sales Trend Shows a Decline:** The line chart indicates a general downward trend in sales over the months displayed, starting from a peak in November and declining in the subsequent months shown[cite: 53, 58]. This could point to seasonality or a need to investigate potential causes for the drop in sales.
